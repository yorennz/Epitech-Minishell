# Epitech-Minishell
Reproduction of a Linux command interpreter with basic commands.

# How to test it?
- After downloading the repository from Github, simply go in from your
terminal and compile it with the "make" command.
- You can now test the command interpreter from the terminal with the command "./mysh".

# Some commands you can take a look at

- ls: show files and folders present in the place you are. You can specify a target by indicating his name.
- cd: allows you to move around your computer by indicating the name of the intended folder.
Example: "cd src/" sends you directly to the source folder of the program. You can verify it by displaying the files around you with the "ls" command.
Note: When you're in a subfolder, you can go back by indicating ".." as destination like that: "cd ..".
- env: print a list of the current environment variables.
- setenv: change or add an environment variable by the following way: "setenv [variable name]=[variable content]"
- unsetenv: remove an environment variable from the environment.
