# Minishell
Reproduction of a Linux command interpreter with basic commands.</br>
I realized this program as part of a school project at Epitech Paris.

## How to test it?ðŸ¤”
- After downloading the repository from Github, simply go in from your
terminal and compile it with the `make` command

- You can now test the command interpreter from the terminal by executing the binary like that:`./mysh`

## Some commands you can take a look at!ðŸ¤“
- <b>ls</b>: show files and folders present in the place you are. You can specify a target by indicating his name

- <b>cd</b>: allows you to move around your computer by indicating the name of the intended folder</br>
Example: `cd src/` sends you directly to the source folder of the program. You can verify it by displaying the files around you with the `ls` command</br>
Note: When you're in a subfolder, you can go back by indicating ".." as destination like that: `cd ..`

- <b>env</b>: print a list of the current environment variables

- <b>setenv</b>: change or add an environment variable by the following way: `setenv [variable name]=[variable content]`

- <b>unsetenv</b>: remove an environment variable from the environment

Here are a bunch of other commands you can try: https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/bin.html.
